[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"Biological systems are complex. We do have a fair amount of information on the individual components that build them up, from the molecules in a cell to the species in an ecosystem, yet it remains unclear how their assembly results in emergent behaviors. Novel technologies have made it possible to easily retrieve large amounts of data, but there is a long way from there to unveiling the first principles of life.\nMy research focuses on communities of cells that have either genetic differences (e.g. bacterial colonies where various species coexist), phenotypic differences (e.g. tissues where all cells have the same DNA sequence but still display variability in size, morphology or activity), or both. Their composition, as well as the interactions between their individuals, determine their properties. Is it possible to understand, predict and ultimately act on how these communities assemble and evolve?\nTo address these questions, I use mathematical modeling, computer simulations and data analyses that complement the experimental skills that I (slowly but steadily!) keep developing. I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, where I work with professor Ramón Díaz-Uriarte on cancer evolution. Soon I will be joining the Sánchez Laboratory at Yale.

Generally, it has been applied at or below the organismal level, by iteratively sampling the mutational landscape in a guided search for genetic variants of higher function. Above the organismal level, a small number of studies have attempted to artificially select microbial communities and ecosystems, with uneven and generally modest success. Our theoretical understanding of artificial ecosystem selection is still limited, particularly for large assemblages of asexual organisms, and we know little about designing efficient methods to direct their evolution. To address this issue, we have developed a flexible modeling framework that allows us to systematically probe any arbitrary selection strategy on any arbitrary set of communities and selected functions, in a wide range of ecological conditions. By artificially selecting hundreds of in-silico microbial metacommunities under identical conditions, we examine the fundamental limits of the two main breeding methods used so far, and prescribe modifications that significantly increase their power. We identify a range of directed evolution strategies that, particularly when applied in combination, are better suited for the top-down engineering of large, diverse, and stable microbial consortia. Our results emphasize that directed evolution allows an ecological structure-function landscape to be navigated in search for dynamically stable and ecologically and functionally resilient high-functioning communities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","tags":null,"title":"Top-down engineering of complex communities by directed evolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.
