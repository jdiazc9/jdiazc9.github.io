Cancer progression models (CPMs) can be used to infer dependencies in mutation accumulation from cross-sectional data and provide predictions of tumor progression paths. But their performance when predicting the complete evolutionary paths is limited by violations of assumptions and the size of available data sets. Instead of predicting full tumor progression paths, we can focus on short-term predictions, more relevant for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Here we examine if five distinct CPMs can be used to answer the question “Given that a genotype with n mutations has been observed, what genotype with n + 1 mutations is next in the path of tumor progression” or, shortly, “What genotype comes next”. Using simulated data we find that under specific combinations of genotype and fitness landscape characteristics CPMs can provide predictions of short-term evolution that closely match the true probabilities, and that some genotype characteristics (fitness and probability of being a local fitness maximum) can be much more relevant than global features. Thus, CPMs can provide short-term predictions even when global, long-term predictions are not possible because fitness landscape- and evolutionary model-specific assumptions are violated. When good performance is possible, we observe significant variation in the quality of predictions of different methods. Genotype-specific and global fitness landscape characteristics are required to determine which method provides best results in each case. Application of these methods to 25 cancer data sets shows that their use is hampered by lack of the information needed to make principled decisions about method choice and what predictions to trust. Fruitful use of these methods for short-term predictions requires adapting their use to local genotype characteristics and obtaining reliable indicators of performance, as well clarifying the interpretation of their results when key assumptions do not hold.","tags":[],"title":"Conditional prediction of consecutive tumor evolution using cancer progression models: What genotype comes next?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chang-Yu Chang","Jean C.C.

Generally, it has been applied at or below the organismal level, by iteratively sampling the mutational landscape in a guided search for genetic variants of higher function. Above the organismal level, a small number of studies have attempted to artificially select microbial communities and ecosystems, with uneven and generally modest success. Our theoretical understanding of artificial ecosystem selection is still limited, particularly for large assemblages of asexual organisms, and we know little about designing efficient methods to direct their evolution. To address this issue, we have developed a flexible modeling framework that allows us to systematically probe any arbitrary selection strategy on any arbitrary set of communities and selected functions, in a wide range of ecological conditions. By artificially selecting hundreds of in-silico microbial metacommunities under identical conditions, we examine the fundamental limits of the two main breeding methods used so far, and prescribe modifications that significantly increase their power. We identify a range of directed evolution strategies that, particularly when applied in combination, are better suited for the top-down engineering of large, diverse, and stable microbial consortia. Our results emphasize that directed evolution allows an ecological structure-function landscape to be navigated in search for dynamically stable and ecologically and functionally resilient high-functioning communities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","tags":null,"title":"Top-down engineering of complex communities by directed evolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.
