Most recently, my work has aimed to predictively link the species-level composition with the functions of ecological communities. The goal is to understand how community-level functions emerge from complex, multi-scale interactions between member species. Ultimately, I seek to develop practical guidelines for the rational design of ecological communities that can optimize a wide variety of functions, from the degradation of environmental pollutants to the fertilization of agricultural soils.\n","date":1579746585,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1579746585,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://jdiazc9.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am currently a postdoctoral scientist working in the Institute of Functional Biology and Genomics at the University of Salamanca, where I recently moved from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University.
